			<div class="tutPreface"><h1 class="tutHead">Lazy Foo' Productions FAQs</h1>
			<h6>Last Updated 1/07/18</h6>
			This page has answers to frequently asked questions regarding the site, the SDL tutorial set and the OpenGL tutorial set.
			</div>

			<h1 class="tutHead">Site FAQs</h1>
			<div class="tutText">
			<h3>Q: I found a bug/typo in the site/source code, where do I report it?</h3>
			A: <a href="faq.php.html#mail" class="tutLink">Contact me</a>.<br>
			<br>
			I admit that the tutorials were a bit rushed, so there's going to be mistakes here and there. Don't be shy, I
			want my tutorials to be bug free.
			</div>
			
			<div class="tutText">
			<h3>Q: How long will it take to for you to get back to me?</h3>
			A: A while.<br/>
			<br/>
			I work in the gaming industry which is prone to over time and I go to grad school. I basically only have a few pockets of free time to work on the site.
			</div>
		
			<div class="tutText">
			<h3>Q: Hey I see you have a Facebook and Twitter. Does that mean if you don't reply to my e-mail immediately I should spam you on there?</h3>
			A: Please don't.<br/>
			<br/>
			I check my e-mail more often than I check social media so e-mail the best way to get into contact with me. If I haven't e-mailed back it's because I don't have time to
			answer it right now.
			</div>

			<div class="tutText">
			<h3>Q: I don't get tutorial/article X.</h3>
			A: Well <a href="faq.php.html#mail" class="tutLink">contact me</a> and I'll try to explain it better and maybe make
			adjustments to the tutorial.<br>
			<br>
			It is in my interest that people learn from my tutorials. If people can't learn from my tutorials, honestly what
			good are they?
			</div>

			<div class="tutText">
			<h3>Q: Can you bundle up all the tutorials/articles?</h3>
			A: Sorry, but because of bandwidth issues I can't do that. Also bundling up every tutorial for a single download
			would cost me hits. What ever little money the site makes through ads helps pay for the hosting bill. Hosting a
			website isn't free you know.
			</div>

			<div class="tutText">
			<h3>Can I use Lazy Font?</h3>
			A: Yes, under 3 conditions.<br>
			<br>
			The conditions go as follows:<br>
			1) The font must be used in a game, either by using the font to render text or in a graphic in the game.<br>
			2) You must not sell your game for profit if it uses the font.<br>
			3) You must acknowledge Lazy Foo' Productions' copyright to the font.
			The acknowledgement can be either with in the actual game itself or in a text file distributed with the game.<br>
			<br>
			I am claiming copyright on Lazy Font in the unlikely case somebody actually makes money off of it. I understand
			it's hard to find fonts when you're starting out, so you newbies can use my font for your games under the above
			conditions.<br>
			<br>
			Get the latest version of the font <a class="tutLink" href="downloads/index.php%3Ffile=Lazy_Font">here</a>.
			</div>

			<div class="tutText">
			<h3>Q: Can I use your code to make a game?</h3>
			A: Basically my rules are:<br>
			1) If you're using it for a closed source program, go nuts.<br>
			2) If you're using it for an open source program, please cite the chunks of code you used with something like:<br>
			<br>
			/*This piece of code was originally from Lazy Foo' Productions<br>
			(http://lazyfoo.net/)*/<br>
			<br>
			3) If you're using it for a GPL, LGPL or other such program which gives public rights to the code,
			I'm going to have to say no.<br>
			4) If you're using it for a tutorial, you're going to have to use your own original code.<br>
			<br>
			You still need <a href="faq.php.html#mail" class="tutLink">contact me</a> and show me specifically the code you plan
			to use and what you're going to do with it so I can approve.
			</div>

			<div class="tutText">
			<h3>Q: Can I use your code to make a tutorial?</h3>
			A: Again, No.<br>
			<br>
			I went through the trouble of making all my own code, and so should you.
			</div>
			
			<div class="tutText">
			<h3>Q: Can I use your code to make a book and sell it for money?</h3>
			A: No and any book that does is unauthorized.
			</div>
			
			<div class="tutText">
			<h3>Q: Can I link to your site?</h3>
			A: Of course. It's just more hits for me.
			</div>

			<div class="tutText">
			<h3>Q: If I link your site will you link mine?</h3>
			A: Sorry, I don't do link exchanges.
			</div>

			<div class="tutText">
			<h3>Q: Do you plan to make any more tutorials/articles?</h3>
			A: Maybe in the future, but currently I want to make personal research projects and prototypes. We'll see what the future holds.
			</div>

			<div class="tutText">
			<h3>Q: I have a program/article, can you post it on the site?</h3>
			A: Sorry, I have a no user content policy. Ignoring the copyright issues, I barely have time to manage my
			own material. I don't have time to manage other people's content.
			</div>

			<div class="tutText">
			<h3>Q: Can I port your code to Java/Perl/Python/C or translate your tutorials to another language?</h3>
			A: No. From what I learned in my business law course, copyright law is sticky to say the least. If I do allow people to translate my tutorials who has rights to those
			translated tutorials is a complete mess. I'd rather just not deal with it.
			</div>

			<h1 class="tutHead">SDL Tutorial FAQs</h1>

			<div class="tutText">
			<h3>Q: How much C++ do I have know to start game programming?</h3>
			A: For my SDL tutorials, you must have a decent handle on the following concepts:<br>
			Operators (+, -, *, /, ++, --, +=, -=, etc)<br>
			Controls (if, else, switch)<br>
			Loops (while, for)<br>
			Functions<br>
			Structs<br>
			Arrays<br>
			References<br>
			Pointers<br>
			Classes and Objects<br>
			How to use a template.<br>
			Bitwise and/or.<br>
			<br>
			The articles might require you to know more, but they'll mention it beforehand.
			Of course the more C++ you know, the better. To make anything complex you'll need to know inheritance,
			polymorphism, templates, and STL. Eventually you'll need to know exceptions, operator overloading and the whole
			language.<br>
			<br>
			Make sure you know these concepts well. Don't just skim over them in a C++ reference book. It doesn't matter how
			much Java/Python/C#/Visual Basic/ASM/HTML/whatever you know. You have to know C++ to be able to learn from the
			tutorials/articles.
			</div>

			<div class="tutText">
			<h3>Q: How much Math do I have know to start game programming?</h3>
			A: For the SDL tutorials, all you need is a good handle on geometry, but the more math you know the better.
			</div>

			<div class="tutText">
			<h3>Q: Why SDL?</h3>
			A: First off it's a very lightweight and easy to use API making it ideal for beginners. Secondly it works on
			multiple operating systems so these tutorials can teach a wider audience.
			</div>

			<div class="tutText">
			<h3>Q: Tutorials 2-54 won't compile, what's wrong?</h3>
			A: Read over tutorial 1 and make sure you set up SDL correctly. SDL is a third party library so you have to set
			it up yourself.
			</div>

			<div class="tutText">
			<h3>Q: Tutorials 6-54 give me errors with IMG_Load/TTF_Init/Mix_OpenAudio.</h3>
			A: Tutorials 6-54 use the SDL_image extension library to load images. I require SDL_image to be used early on in
			the tutorials because:<br>
			<br>
			1) I can then use PNG images which are smaller than bitmaps. This means less bandwidth use.<br>
			2) It's important to know how to set up extension libraries. I might as well teach you how early on.<br>
			<br>
			In the zip file for every tutorial program, the readme.txt file tells you which libraries you need to link
			against. Make sure you have all the proper libraries set up.<br>
			<br>
			In my tutorial set, I use SDL_image, SDL_ttf, and SDL_mixer. It's a good idea to have them all set up ASAP.
			</div>

			<div class="tutText">
			<h3>Q: Where are the SDL 1.2 tutorials?</h3>
			A: <a class="tutLink" href="SDL_tutorials/index.php.html">They're still in the same spot</a>.
			</div>

			<div class="tutText">
			<h3>Q: I have an issue with the 1.2 tutorials</h3>
			A: Sorry but they are no longer being updated. All SDL tutorial updates are done on the SDL 2.0 tutorial.
			</div>
			
			<h1 class="tutHead">OpenGL FAQs</h1>

			<div class="tutText">
			<h3>Q: How much C++ do I have know to start these tutorials?</h3>
			A: For my tutorials, you must have a decent handle on the following concepts:
			<ul>
			<li>Operators (+, -, *, /, ++, --, +=, -=, etc)</li>
			<li>Controls (if, else, switch)</li>
			<li>Loops (while, for)</li>
			<li>Functions</li>
			<li>Structs</li>
			<li>Arrays</li>
			<li>References</li>
			<li>Pointers</li>
			<li>Classes and Objects</li>
			<li>Inhertance and Polymorphism</li>
			<li>How to use a template.</li>
			<li>Bitwise and/or.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			I also recommend having experience with simpler 2D graphics API like SDL before jumping into OpenGL.
			</div>

			<div class="tutText">
			<h3>Q: How much Math do I have know to start these tutorials?</h3>
			A: You should know vector math and matrix multiplication. If you don't know these, I have an
			<a href="articles/article10/index.php.html" class="tutLink">OpenGL math primer</a> article designed for people that have taken high school geometry. It won't teach you
			everything you need, but it should be enough to get you started with OpenGL.
			</div>

			<div class="tutText">
			<h3>Q: Why freeGLUT?</h3>
			A: As I mentioned in the the first tutorial, freeGLUT may not be the most feature rich API but it's good at creating quick and dirty OpenGL demos which these tutorials
			use.<br>
			<br>
			freeGLUT is probably not what you want to use to publish a full application (I mention other libraries in the first tutorial), but for testing OpenGL code it does the job.
			</div>

			<div class="tutText">
			<h3>Q: Why are you using the fixed function pipeline? That makes you worse than Satan.</h3>
			A: Because I've tried to do an OpenGL tutorial set that uses programmable pipeline from the the start and the test audience just wasn't getting it. These tutorials aren't
			here to regurgitate theory to people who already know graphics programming, they're here to help out beginners. Having concepts like GPU pipelines go over their heads
			isn't very helpful.<br>
			<br>
			So this tutorial set uses fixed function built in capabilites as a stepping stone to modern programmable pipelines. In the end, they're learning OpenGL 3.0+ code anyway.
			Besides, many of the code graphics algorithms (like Phoung Shading), were developed in the 1970s. The algorithm hasn't changed, only the tools to implement it have.
			</div>

			<div class="tutText">
			<h3>Q: Tutorials won't compile, what's wrong?</h3>
			A: Read over tutorial 1 and make sure you set up freeGLUT and OpenGL correctly. freeGLUT is a third party library and OpenGL typically isn't linked by default so you have
			to set it up yourself.
			</div>

			<div class="tutText">
			<h3>Q: Will you be making 3D tutorials?</h3>
			A: To make a decent 3D tutorial set, I would have to triple the size of the current tutorial set. That's something I just don't have time for right now.
			</div>
			
			<h1 class="tutHead">Misc FAQs</h1>

			<div class="tutText">
			<h3><a name="mail" class="tutLink">Q: What's your e-mail?</a></h3>
			A: lazyfoo &#065&#116 gmail. <- I have to type it like that or spambots will get to me.
			</div>

			<div class="tutText">
			<h3>Q: Did you really have to hide your e-mail like that?</h3>
			A: I'm not against getting e-mails (questions do make my tutorials better) but at least 3/4ths of the e-mails I get are answered in the FAQs. This can only mean people don't read
			the contact page and just fish for an e-mail. It's better for people to skim through the FAQs before e-mailing me so we both don't waste time.
