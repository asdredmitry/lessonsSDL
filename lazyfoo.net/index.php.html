<div class="announcement">The Good News: Setting up SDL2 on Android is significantly easier on Android Studio than the old SDK Tools.<br><br>The Bad News: Google deprecated the old SDK Tools which my Android set up tools used.<br><br>The Better News: The Android Studio Windows set up tutorial is now up! I'll get the other ones up ASAP.<br><br>The Not So Good News: It may take me a while. Things are getting hectic at work again. </div>

<div class ="date">01/08/17 - 11:32:51 PM</div>
<div class="announcement">Happy new year everyone. Again I'd like to thank the donors because they're the ones that help take care of hosting for the site.<br><br>There are those out there that try to help out by reporting bugs on the site. I thank you for that, but you have probably noticed that these bugs are yet to be fixed.<br><br>I am sure many of you heard how grueling the game industry can be. You have no idea how true that is. I was fortunate enough to get 7 days off for the holidays, but I spent it all catching up doing everything else I wasn't able to do to during the year when I wanted to spend time clearing out the bug backlog before the year ended.<br><br>Unfortunately, things are only going to get even more hectic in the coming weeks. I have major deadlines coming up at work and overtime is almost guaranteed. It may be until March before I can do any significant work on the site again.<br><br>Still, if you see a bug report it. When I finally have time again, I'll be happy that you did.</div>

<div class ="date">02/15/16 - 5:58:53 PM</div>
<div class="announcement">Finally, the bug backlog is clear. I also made the text a bit brighter to make it easier to read.<br><br>You're probably wondering why it took so long to get through all these bugs. I am different point in my life than I was when I started this site. I am not a college student, but an adult with rent to pay. I no longer make games just for fun, but to keep my head above water in an industry that's super competitive.<br><br>It should have been obvious I don't really have all that much time to dedicate to the site anymore. I still plan to maintain it, but the only content I plan adding is the audio recording tutorial once that's implemented in SDL 2. I may add more content in the future but for now I am focusing on maintaining the website. Keep those bug reports coming because I am still going to keep the site up to date.<br><br>Oh and if you see that your bug hasn't been fixed yet, sorry that it got buried in the mass of e-mail I get. Resend it and I'll get to it when I can.</div>

<div class ="date">12/13/15 - 9:33:15 PM</div>
<div class="announcement">Ok, I currently going through the bug backlog. Managed to shrink it down from 100+ to 40. Consider work is ramping up to get something shipped before Christmas, it's going to take a little longer than already expected to get things finished. My goal is to knock them all out by the end of the year.<br><br>And guys, most of these issue I was e-mailed about had nothing to do with the site itself. They were general programming questions that could have been solved had they typed the question in Google. Search engines are your friends, people.</div>

<div class ="date">08/23/15 - 5:42:07 PM</div>
<div class="announcement">Linux Android tutorials are now up! This means the SDL tutorials are now feature complete.<br><br>Next up on the agenda: getting through that bug backlog. Please send in any bugs you find via e-mail.</div>
