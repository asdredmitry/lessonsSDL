<div class="tutPreface"><h1 class="tutHead">State Machines</h1>
<h6>Last Updated 12/27/11</h6>
It's important to know how to move between the various modes of a game. State machines allow you to do just that.
</div>

<div class="tutText">
Let me start off by saying this is a huge article. The source code for the demo program is over 1000 lines of
code. We use motion, collision detection and scrolling so make sure you know do how to these things. You'll also
need a good understanding of game loops. State machines are all about changing how your game loop functions.<br>
<br>
You're also going to have to know inheritance and polymorphism. If you're not familiar these concepts in C++ I
recommend you learn them. Besides needing them for this article, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism are
the key concepts of object oriented programming. If you ever want to use C++ effectively, you're going to have to
learn them eventually. We also use operator overloading in the example program, but it's not vital to your
understanding of state machines so don't worry about it too much. Now on with the lesson.<br>
<br>
Say you have various modes in your game like a title screen, menus, and the levels of your game. For each of those
modes the events, logic, and rendering work differently. To change the way your game loop works, we use a state
machine to transition between the different states.<br>
<br>
The particular type of state machine used here is called a finite state machine. There's two common ways to
implement this type of state machine.
</div>

<div class="tutCode">//Do logic
switch( gameState )
{
    case STATE_INTRO:
    intro_logic();
    break;

    case STATE_TITLE:
    title_logic();
    break;
	
    case STATE_OVERWORLD:
    overworld_logic();
    break;
}
</div>

<div class="tutText">
Here's what a state machine's logic module would look like if it was used implementing the switch/case method. As
you can see, the behavior varies depending on the current game state.<br>
<br>
Then there's the object oriented method.
</div>

<div class="tutCode">//Create game state object
GameState currentState = new myState();

//Run main loop
while( quit == false )
{
    //Do events
    currentState->events();
    
    //Do logic
    currentState->logic();

    //Change state if needed
    change_state();
	
    //Render
    currentState->render();
}
</div>

<div class="tutText">
Here's what the object oriented method would look like.<br>
<br>
Now with the object oriented method, we create a base game state class with virtual functions for each part of the
game loop. Then we have game state classes that inherit from the base class and override the functions to work as
the game state needs them to. To switch the game state, we simply change the game state object as needed.<br>
<br>
In our demonstration, we use the object oriented method as opposed to the switch/case method. Why, you ask?
</div>

<div class="tutCode">while ( quit == false )
{
    //Do events
    switch( gameState )
    {
        case STATE_INTRO:
        intro_events();
        break;

        case STATE_TITLE:
        title_events();
        break;
	
        case STATE_MENU:
        menu_events();
        break;
	
        case STATE_STAGE01:
        stage01_events();
        break;
	
        case STATE_STAGE02:
        stage02_events();
        break;
	
        case STATE_STAGE03:
        stage03_events();
        break;
	
        case STATE_STAGE04:
        stage04_events();
        break;
	
        case STATE_STAGE05:
        stage05_events();
        break;
	
        case STATE_BONUS_STAGE:
        bonus_stage_events();
        break;
    }
	
    //Do logic
    switch( gameState )
    {
        case STATE_INTRO:
        intro_logic();
        break;

        case STATE_TITLE:
        title_logic();
        break;
	
        case STATE_MENU:
        menu_logic();
        break;
	
        case STATE_STAGE01:
        stage01_logic();
        break;
	
        case STATE_STAGE02:
        stage02_logic();
        break;
	
        case STATE_STAGE03:
        stage03_logic();
        break;
	
        case STATE_STAGE04:
        stage04_logic();
        break;
	
        case STATE_STAGE05:
        stage05_logic();
        break;
	
        case STATE_BONUS_STAGE:
        bonus_stage_logic();
        break;
    }
	
    //Change the state if needed
    change_state();
	
    //Do Rendering
    switch( gameState )
    {
        case STATE_INTRO:
        intro_render();
        break;

        case STATE_TITLE:
        title_render();
        break;
	
        case STATE_MENU:
        menu_render();
        break;
	
        case STATE_STAGE01:
        stage01_render();
        break;
	
        case STATE_STAGE02:
        stage02_render();
        break;
	
        case STATE_STAGE03:
        stage03_render();
        break;
	
        case STATE_STAGE04:
        stage04_render();
        break;
	
        case STATE_STAGE05:
        stage05_render();
        break;
	
        case STATE_BONUS_STAGE:
        bonus_stage_render();
        break;
    }
}
</div>

<div class="tutText">
The problem with the switch/case method is that it can get cluttered pretty quickly. There's only 9 states
represented here and just look how many lines of code there are. It's also a pain having to keep track of all
those case statements.<br>
<br>
With the object oriented method in our demo, the state manager only needs 3 lines more of code per state compared
to the 9 the switch/case method would need. So it's best to keep the switch/case method to small scale stuff like
changing a sprite's animation.<br>
<br>
So let's get started with our state machine demo.
</div>

<div class="tutCode">//Game states
enum GameStates
{
    STATE_NULL,
    STATE_INTRO,
    STATE_TITLE,
    STATE_GREEN_OVERWORLD,
    STATE_RED_ROOM,
    STATE_BLUE_ROOM,
    STATE_EXIT,
};
</div>

<div class="tutText">
Here are the constants we're going to use to represent the various states in our application.<br>
<br>

<div class="tutImg">First we have the intro screen. It's the state we start in.<br>
<img src="intro.jpg"><br>
</div>
<br>
<div class="tutImg">Then when the user presses a key we move to the title screen.<br>
<img src="title.jpg"><br>
</div>
<br>
<div class="tutImg">When the user presses a key again we move to the overworld.<br>
<img src="green.jpg"><br>
</div>
<br>
<div class="tutImg">When the user moves the dot over the red house in the upper left corner, we move into the red room.<br>
<img src="red.jpg"><br>
When they go through the door, they go back to the overworld.
</div>
<br>
<div class="tutImg">When the user moves the dot over the blue house in the bottom right corner of the overworld,
we move into the blue room.<br>
<img src="blue.jpg"><br>
We they go through the door, they go back to the overworld just like with the red room.
</div>
<br>
The exit state is used when the user wants to quit the program. Setting the state to exit is like setting quit to
true in our other applications.<br>
<br>
The NULL state is used when we want to say that there is no state we want to change to. You'll see it in action
in the change_state() function later on.
</div>

<div class="tutCode">/*Classes*/
//Game state base class
class GameState
{
    public:
    virtual void handle_events() = 0;
    virtual void logic() = 0;
    virtual void render() = 0;
    virtual ~GameState(){};
};
</div>

<div class="tutText">
Here's the base class for all our game state classes. You can see we have virtual functions for each part of a
game loop and a virtual destructor.
</div>

<div class="tutCode">//State status manager
void set_next_state( int newState );

//State changer
void change_state();
</div>

<div class="tutText">
Here are our functions for managing our game state. We use set_next_state() to set the state we want to change to
and change_state() changes the actual game state object. We'll go into more detail on how these work later. 
</div>

<div class="tutCode">//State variables
int stateID = STATE_NULL;
int nextState = STATE_NULL;

//Game state object
GameState *currentState = NULL;
</div>

<div class="tutText">
These are the variables we use to manage our state machine. "stateID" tells us what the current state is, and
"nextState" obviously tells us what the next state is going to be when we want to change it.<br>
<br>
Last but certainly not least is "currentState" which points to the current state object.
</div>

<div class="tutCode">bool load_files()
{
    //Load the dot image
    dot = load_image( "dot.bmp" );
    
    //If there was a problem in loading the dot
    if( dot == NULL )
    {
        return false;    
    }
    
    //Open the font
    font = TTF_OpenFont( "lazy.ttf", 36 );
    
    //If there was an error in loading the font
    if( font == NULL )
    {
        return false;
    }
    
    //If everything loaded fine
    return true;
}
</div>

<div class="tutText">
Here's our main file loading function which loads the dot graphic and the font. We'll want these resources
available in whatever state we're in.
</div>

<div class="tutCode">class Intro : public GameState
{
    private:
    //Intro background
    SDL_Surface *background;
    
    //Intro message
    SDL_Surface *message;
    
    public:
    //Loads intro resources
    Intro();
    //Frees intro resources
    ~Intro();
    
    //Main loop functions
    void handle_events();
    void logic();
    void render();
};

class Title : public GameState
{
    private:
    //Title screen background
    SDL_Surface *background;
    
    //Title screen message
    SDL_Surface *message;
    
    public:
    //Loads title screen resources
    Title();
    //Frees title resources
    ~Title();
    
    //Main loop functions
    void handle_events();
    void logic();
    void render();
};
</div>

<div class="tutText">
Here are the class declarations for the intro and title screen states which inherit from the GameState class.
They both just show a message on a background.<br>
<br>
They have a background and message surfaces, constructors and destructors, and their functions for the game loop.
</div>

<div class="tutCode">Intro::Intro()
{
    //Load the background
    background = load_image( "introbg.png" );
    
    //Render the intro message
    message = TTF_RenderText_Solid( font, "Lazy Foo' Productions Presents...", textColor );
}

Intro::~Intro()
{
    //Free the surfaces
    SDL_FreeSurface( background );
    SDL_FreeSurface( message );
}
</div>

<div class="tutText">
In the intro state constructor we load the background image and render the message which we're going to need while
in the intro game state. Naturally, in the destructor we free these resources.
</div>

<div class="tutCode">void Intro::handle_events()
{
    //While there's events to handle
    while( SDL_PollEvent( &event ) )
    {
        //If the user has Xed out the window
        if( event.type == SDL_QUIT )
        {
            //Quit the program
            set_next_state( STATE_EXIT );
        }
        //If the user pressed enter
        else if( ( event.type == SDL_KEYDOWN ) && ( event.key.keysym.sym == SDLK_RETURN ) )
        {
            //Move to the title screen
            set_next_state( STATE_TITLE );
        }
    }
}
</div>

<div class="tutText">
Here's the event handling function for the intro game state.<br>
<br>
When the user tries to quit we set the next state to exit using set_next_state(). When the user presses enter,
we want to move to the title screen so we set the next state to the title screen.<br>
<br>
You're probably wondering how set_next_state() works. Well then let's take a look.
</div>

<div class="tutCode">void set_next_state( int newState )
{
    //If the user doesn't want to exit
    if( nextState != STATE_EXIT )
    {
        //Set the next state
        nextState = newState;
    }
}
</div>

<div class="tutText">
All set_next_state() does is set the "nextState" variable.<br>
<br>
Remember that a good game loop is modular so we can't be changing game state objects all over the place. All the
actual game state object changing happens in the change_state() function (which we'll get to in a little bit). So
we use set_next_state() to request what state we want to change to.<br>
<br>
You might be asking yourself why we check if the user wants to exit. It can happen where there's two or more
requests to change states before getting to the change_state() function.<br>
<br>
Say if the user tries to x out in the events module and "nextState" gets set to STATE_EXIT and then dot moves
over the red house in the logic module and "nextState" gets set to STATE_RED_HOUSE. This means the request to exit
the application will be ignored.<br>
<br>
But since the function checks if the user wanted to exit before changing the next state, the user quit will always
go through.
</div>

<div class="tutCode">void Intro::logic()
{

}

void Intro::render()
{
    //Show the background
    apply_surface( 0, 0, background, screen );
    
    //Show the message
    apply_surface( ( SCREEN_WIDTH - message->w ) / 2, ( SCREEN_HEIGHT - message->h ) / 2, message, screen );
}
</div>

<div class="tutText">
In the intro's logic module, you can see that nothing is going there. The rendering module simply shows the
background with the message on top.<br>
<br>
Now you've seen how a game state class works and how we request state changes, but where and how do we change
state objects? Let's take a look at the main loop.
</div>

<div class="tutCode">    //While the user hasn't quit
    while( stateID != STATE_EXIT )
    {
        //Start the frame timer
        fps.start();
        
        //Do state event handling
        currentState->handle_events();
        
        //Do state logic
        currentState->logic();
        
        //Change state if needed
        change_state();
        
        //Do state rendering
        currentState->render();
        
        //Update the screen
        if( SDL_Flip( screen ) == -1 )
        {
            return 1;    
        }
        
        //Cap the frame rate
        if( fps.get_ticks() < 1000 / FRAMES_PER_SECOND )
        {
            SDL_Delay( ( 1000 / FRAMES_PER_SECOND ) - fps.get_ticks() );
        }
    }
</div>

<div class="tutText">
In the main loop, you see the standard event, logic and rendering modules. Changing of the game state object
happens at the end of the logic module, after we call the game state object's logic() function.<br>
<br>
Also notice that change_state() is called before the rendering module. Remember that because it's important when
we look next at how change_state() works.
</div>

<div class="tutCode">void change_state()
{
    //If the state needs to be changed
    if( nextState != STATE_NULL )
    {
        //Delete the current state
        if( nextState != STATE_EXIT )
        {
            delete currentState;
        }
</div>

<div class="tutText">
Here's the top of our state changing function.<br>
<br>
First thing we do is check if "nextState" is not STATE_NULL. If it is NULL, it means that there's no state to change to
and change_state() doesn't do anything.<br>
<br>
If we need to change the state, we check if the next state is STATE_EXIT. If it's not, we delete the game object
so the destructor is called and frees all the resources for that game state. Now we can have a new game state
object which we'll get in the next bit of code.<br>
<br>
But why don't we want to delete the object if the user wants to exit? It's because there's no game state class for
exit and STATE_EXIT is just there to break the game loop. If we delete the current game state object, after
change_state() is done, the game loop will try to call render() from the game state object that was just deleted
which isn't good. So we just skip the deletion in change_state(), render using the current game state object one
last time and end the game loop so we can exit the program.
</div>

<div class="tutCode">        //Change the state
        switch( nextState )
        {
            case STATE_TITLE:
                currentState = new Title();
                break;
                
            case STATE_GREEN_OVERWORLD:
                currentState = new OverWorld( stateID );
                break;
                
            case STATE_RED_ROOM:
                currentState = new RedRoom();
                break;
                
            case STATE_BLUE_ROOM:
                currentState = new BlueRoom();
                break;
        }
        
        //Change the current state ID
        stateID = nextState;
        
        //NULL the next state ID
        nextState = STATE_NULL;    
    }
}
</div>

<div class="tutText">
After we delete our old game state object it's time to get a new one. This switch/case block gives us our new
object depending on what "nextState" is. When we create the new game state object, the constructor is called and
the constructor of our game state loads the resources it needs.<br>
<br>
Notice how the constructor for the OverWorld game state takes in "stateID". You can see "stateID" doesn't change
to the new state until after the switch/case block. So this means the OverWorld object is getting the ID of the
last active state. You'll see why the OverWorld object needs to know the previous state when we get to its class
definition.<br>
<br>
Lastly in the change_state() function we set "nextState" to STATE_NULL because we're done changing the state.<br>
<br>
Now let's see how the rest of the state classes work.
</div>

<div class="tutCode">void Title::handle_events()
{
    //While there's events to handle
    while( SDL_PollEvent( &event ) )
    {
        //If the user has Xed out the window
        if( event.type == SDL_QUIT )
        {
            //Quit the program
            set_next_state( STATE_EXIT );
        }
        //If the user pressed enter
        else if( ( event.type == SDL_KEYDOWN ) && ( event.key.keysym.sym == SDLK_RETURN ) )
        {
            //Go to the overworld
            set_next_state( STATE_GREEN_OVERWORLD );
        }
    }
}
</div>

<div class="tutText">
If you've seen the intro class, you already know how the title screen works. They both just show messages on a
background. They just show different messages on different backgrounds.<br>
<br>
The biggest difference is that in the title screen when the user presses enter, we set the next state to be the
overworld.
</div>

<div class="tutCode">//The dot
class Dot
{
    private:
    //The collision box of the dot
    SDL_Rect box;
    
    //The velocity of the dot
    int xVel, yVel;
    
    //The current level dimensions
    int curLvlWidth;
    int curLvlHeight;
    
    public:
    //Initializes the variables
    Dot();
    
    //Sets the dot
    void init( int x, int y, int lvlWidth, int lvlHeight );
    
    //Handles keypress
    void handle_input();
    
    //Moves the dot
    void move();
    
    //Shows the dot
    void show();
    
    //Sets the camera over the dot
    void set_camera();
    
    //Gets the dot's collision box
    operator SDL_Rect();
};
</div>

<div class="tutText">
Here's our friend the Dot class we modified for our state machine demo.<br>
<br>
The dot sets the camera but the overworld, red room, and blue room have different sizes. This means the dot needs
to know the dimensions of the level it's in and that's why it has the "curLvlWidth" and "curLvlHeight" variables.
It also needs to know the size of the level to keep inside of it.<br>
<br>
We have the init() so when we change the game state, we can set the dot's position and get the current level's
dimensions.
</div>

<div class="tutCode">class OverWorld : public GameState
{
    private:
    //Level dimensions
    const static int LEVEL_WIDTH = 1280;
    const static int LEVEL_HEIGHT = 960;
    
    //Overworld background
    SDL_Surface *background;
    
    //The houses
    House redHouse;
    House blueHouse;
    
    public:
    //Loads resources and intializes objects
    OverWorld( int prevState );
    
    //Frees resources
    ~OverWorld();
    
    //Main loop functions
    void handle_events();
    void logic();
    void render();
};
</div>

<div class="tutText">
Here's the breakdown of the overworld game state.<br>
<br>
First we have the constants defining the level dimensions. Then we have the graphic for the background.<br>
<br>
Then we have the two house objects that the dot is going to interact with. The dot itself is a global object.
Using globals is something to avoid unless the way around it is uglier and believe me in this case it's ugly.<br>
<br>
Then we have the constructor, destructor, and game loop functions.
</div>

<div class="tutCode">OverWorld::OverWorld( int prevState )
{
    //Load the background
    background = load_image( "greenoverworld.png" );
    
    //Set the houses
    redHouse.init( 0, 0, load_image( "red.bmp" ) );
    blueHouse.init( 1240, 920, load_image( "blue.bmp" ) );
</div>

<div class="tutText">
First thing we do in the overworld constructor is load the background, then place the houses and load their
images.
</div>

<div class="tutCode">    //If the last state was the red room
    if( prevState == STATE_RED_ROOM )
    {
        //Show up in front of the red house
        myDot.init( 10, 40, LEVEL_WIDTH, LEVEL_HEIGHT );
    }
    //If the last state was the blue room
    else if( prevState == STATE_BLUE_ROOM )
    {
        //Show up in front of the blue house
        myDot.init( 1250, 900, LEVEL_WIDTH, LEVEL_HEIGHT );
    }
    //If the last state was something else
    else
    {
        //Show up in the center of the overworld
        myDot.init( 630, 470, LEVEL_WIDTH, LEVEL_HEIGHT );
    }
}
</div>

<div class="tutText">
After we're done loading, it's time to set the dot depending on what the previous state was.<br>
<br>
If the dot just came out of the red room, we place it in front of the door of the red house. If it came
out of the blue house, we place it in front of the door of the blue house. If it came from any other state (like
the title screen) we put the dot in the center of the overworld.
</div>

<div class="tutCode">OverWorld::~OverWorld()
{
    //Free the resources
    SDL_FreeSurface( background );
}
</div>

<div class="tutText">
Like with the intro and title screens, we free our resources in the destructor.<br>
<br>
You may be wondering where we free the graphics we loaded for the houses in the constructor. When the OverWorld
object is deleted, the house objects go out of scope and their destructors are called. That's where we free
the house surface and you can look in the source code if you want to.
</div>

<div class="tutCode">void OverWorld::handle_events()
{
    //While there's events to handle
    while( SDL_PollEvent( &event ) )
    {
        //Handle events for the dot
        myDot.handle_input();
            
        //If the user has Xed out the window
        if( event.type == SDL_QUIT )
        {
            //Quit the program
            set_next_state( STATE_EXIT );
        }
    }
}
</div>

<div class="tutText">
For the overworld event handling, we just do Dot input and we handle the user quit.
</div>

<div class="tutCode">void OverWorld::logic()
{
    //If the dot touches the red house
    if( check_collision( myDot, redHouse ) == true )
    {
        //Move to the red room
        set_next_state( STATE_RED_ROOM );
    }
    //If the dot touches the blue house
    else if( check_collision( myDot, blueHouse ) == true )
    {
        //Move to the blue room
        set_next_state( STATE_BLUE_ROOM );
    }
    
    //Move the dot
    myDot.move();
}
</div>

<div class="tutText">
For the overworld logic we check if the dot is touching one of the houses. If it touches the red house we set the
next state to the red room and if it touches the blue house we set the next state to the blue room.<br>
<br>
After we're done checking collision we move the dot as usual.
</div>

<div class="tutCode">void OverWorld::render()
{
    //Set the camera
    myDot.set_camera();
        
    //Show the background
    apply_surface( 0, 0, background, screen, &camera );
    
    //Show the rooms
    redHouse.show();
    blueHouse.show();
    
    //Show the dot on the screen
    myDot.show();
}
</div>

<div class="tutText">
Then in the rendering module we set the camera, show the background, show the houses. and show the dot on the
screen.
</div>

<div class="tutCode">class RedRoom : public GameState

    void logic();
    void render();

</div>

<div class="tutText">
Here the are red and blue room game states. They pretty much work the same except that they have different
backgrounds and the door is in different place.
</div>

<div class="tutCode">RedRoom::RedRoom()
{
    //Load the background
    background = load_image( "redroom.png" );
    
    //Set the exit
    exit.init( 310, 440 );
    
    //Set the dot
    myDot.init( 310, 420, LEVEL_WIDTH, LEVEL_HEIGHT );
}
</div>

<div class="tutText">
In the red room's constructor we load the background, place the exit door and place the dot in front of the door
it came in through.
</div>

<div class="tutCode">void RedRoom::logic()
{
    //If the dot went to the exit
    if( check_collision( myDot, exit ) == true )

        set_next_state( STATE_GREEN_OVERWORLD );
    }
    
    //Move the dot
    myDot.move();
}
</div>

<div class="tutText">
For the logic module we check if the dot went through the exit. If it did we set the next state so we can go back
to the overworld.<br>
<br>
Then we move the dot as usual.
</div>

<div class="tutCode">void RedRoom::render()
{
    //Set the camera
    myDot.set_camera();
        
    //Show the background
    apply_surface( 0, 0, background, screen, &camera );
    
    //Show the door
    exit.show();
    
    //Show the dot on the screen
    myDot.show();
}
</div>

<div class="tutText">
When we render, we set the camera, show the background, show the exit and show the dot.
</div>

<div class="tutCode">BlueRoom::BlueRoom()
{
    //Load the background
    background = load_image( "blueroom.png" );

    //Set the dot
    myDot.init( 310, 40, LEVEL_WIDTH, LEVEL_HEIGHT );
}
</div>

<div class="tutText">
Again, the blue room is pretty much the same story as with the red room. We load the background, place the exit
and place the dot in front of the exit.
</div>

<div class="tutCode">    //Set the current state ID
    stateID = STATE_INTRO;
    
    //Set the current game state object
    currentState = new Intro();
</div>

<div class="tutText">
In the main() function after we intialize and load our files, we set the state ID to the intro screen and we create
our intro game state object.
</div>

<div class="tutCode">    //While the user hasn't quit
    while( stateID != STATE_EXIT )
    {
        //Start the frame timer
        fps.start();
        
        //Do state event handling
        currentState->handle_events();
        
        //Do state logic
        currentState->logic();
        
        //Change state if needed
        change_state();
        
        //Do state rendering
        currentState->render();
        
        //Update the screen
        if( SDL_Flip( screen ) == -1 )
        {
            return 1;    
        }
        
        //Cap the frame rate
        if( fps.get_ticks() < 1000 / FRAMES_PER_SECOND )
        {
            SDL_Delay( ( 1000 / FRAMES_PER_SECOND ) - fps.get_ticks() );
        }
    }
</div>

<div class="tutText">
Here's our game loop once again. This will keep looping until the user sets the next state to STATE_EXIT.<br>
<br>
Hopefully you remember how change_state() won't delete the game state object when the user exits because it needs
something to render with. Well where does it delete the old object?
</div>

<div class="tutCode">void clean_up()
{
    //Delete game state and free state resources
    delete currentState;
    
    //Free the surfaces
    SDL_FreeSurface( dot );

    //Close the font that was used
    TTF_CloseFont( font );
    
    //Quit SDL_ttf
    TTF_Quit();
     
    //Quit SDL
    SDL_Quit();
}
</div>

<div class="tutText">
The object gets deleted in the clean up function so the object's destructor can free its resources. We also
free the global resources and quit SDL.<br>
<br>
There are other types of state machines besides the finite state machine, like stack or array based state machines.
Different types of state machines are more useful depending on your game, but the fundamentals are the same.
If you understand how to make this type of state machine, the others shouldn't be too hard to figure out.
