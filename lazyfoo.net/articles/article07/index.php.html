<div class="tutPreface"><h1 class="tutHead">Using Multiple Source Files</h1>
<h6>Last Updated 7/16/12</h6>
As you saw with the last article, program source codes can get pretty big.
Here you'll learn how to break your program's source into smaller, easier to manage pieces.
</div>

<div class="tutText">
The state machine demo had over 1000 lines of code. Any of you that have tried know it's a pain having to
search through one big source file. By having your program's source split into multiple source files, you no
longer have to sift through one big chunk of code.<br>
<br>
When dealing with multiple source files there's basically two types of files you're going to be dealing with:
source files and header files. Standard *.cpp source files you already know as you've been using them since you
started programming. Headers, however, are a bit tricky.<br>
<br>
To try to understand what headers do, look in the SDL_image.h file. Inside, you'll see a bunch of declarations of
the functions in the SDL_image API like IMG_Load(), IMG_GetError(), IMG_isPNG(), etc, but you don't actually see
the definitions of the functions that load the images, get the errors, and such. Is all that headers do is declare
constants/classes/functions/variables?<br>
<br>
The answer is yes. All SDL_image.h does is tell the compiler about the functions in SDL_image so it can compile
your source file. Is that all it needs? Well, when you try to build your executable, the compiler will compile
your source file, then the linker will try to link everything together into one binary. After it compiles your .cpp
file, it will try to look up the actual definitions for the SDL_image functions. When the linker doesn't find the
function definitions in one of the *.cpp files in your project, it will complain that it can't find the
definitions and abort.<br>
<br>
Well where is the actual code for SDL_image functions? The functions are compiled inside of the SDL_image binary
(*.dll on windows and *.so on *nix). To get the linker to stop complaining, we give it a lib file which tells the
linker where function definitions are in the SDL_image binary so it can link dynamically at the program's run time.<br>
<br>
This might not make much sense now, but it will after we get our hands dirty by splitting up the motion tutorial
source code into mulitple files.
</div>

<div class="tutCode">#ifndef CONSTANTS_H
#define CONSTANTS_H

//The screen attributes
const int SCREEN_WIDTH = 640;
const int SCREEN_HEIGHT = 480;
const int SCREEN_BPP = 32;

//The frame rate
const int FRAMES_PER_SECOND = 20;

//The dimensions of the dot
const int DOT_WIDTH = 20;
const int DOT_HEIGHT = 20;

#endif
</div>

<div class="tutText">
Here's the code inside of the constants.h file. This header file declares the constants we're going to use in the
program.<br>
<br>
The preprocessors at the top and the bottom might be new to you. For those of you who don't know what a
preprocessor is, it's basically a way to talk to the compiler. For example the #include preprocessor tells the
compiler to include a file into the code.<br>
<br>
What "#ifndef CONSTANTS_H" does is asks <b>if</b> CONSTANTS_H is <b>n</b>ot <b>def</b>ined. If CONSTANTS_H is not
defined, the next line defines CONSTANTS_H. Then we continue on with the code that defines the constants. Then
#endif serves as the end of the "#ifndef CONSTANTS_H" condition block.<br>
<br>
Now why did we do that?
</div>

<div class="tutCode">#include "constants.h"
#include "constants.h"
</div>

<div class="tutText">
Let's say we had a situation where we included the same file twice.<br>
<br>
In the first line where we include constants.h, the compiler will check if CONSTANTS_H is defined. Since it's not,
it will define CONSTANTS_H and use the constants code inside the constants.h normally.<br>
<br>
In the second line when we try to include constants.h, the compiler will try check if CONSTANTS_H is defined.
Because CONSTANTS_H was defined already, it will skip past the code that defines the constants. This prevents the
constants from being defined twice and causing a conflict.<br>
<br>
So now you see how this simple but effective safeguard works.
</div>

<div class="tutCode">#ifndef BACON
#define BACON

//The screen attributes
const int SCREEN_WIDTH = 640;
const int SCREEN_HEIGHT = 480;
const int SCREEN_BPP = 32;

//The frame rate
const int FRAMES_PER_SECOND = 20;

//The dimensions of the dot
const int DOT_WIDTH = 20;
const int DOT_HEIGHT = 20;

#endif
</div>

<div class="tutText">
Just for the sake of information, what definition you check for doesn't matter. The above code will work perfectly.
The thing is, using FILENAME_H is the common naming standard and as I have mentioned before it's important to use
a naming standard.
</div>

<div class="tutCode">#ifndef CLASSES_H
#define CLASSES_H

//The dot that will move around on the screen
class Dot
{
    private:
    //The X and Y offsets of the dot
    int x, y;
    
    //The velocity of the dot
    int xVel, yVel;
    
    public:
    //Initializes the variables
    Dot();
    
    //Takes key presses and adjusts the dot's velocity
    void handle_input();
    
    //Moves the dot
    void move();
    
    //Shows the dot on the screen
    void show();
};

//The timer
class Timer
{
    private:
    //The clock time when the timer started
    int startTicks;
    
    //The ticks stored when the timer was paused
    int pausedTicks;
    
    //The timer status
    bool paused;
    bool started;
    
    public:
    //Initializes variables
    Timer();
    
    //The various clock actions
    void start();
    void stop();
    void pause();
    void unpause();
    
    //Gets the timer's time
    int get_ticks();
    
    //Checks the status of the timer
    bool is_started();
    bool is_paused();    
};

#endif
</div>

<div class="tutText">
Here's the classes.h file which declares the Dot and Timer classes.<br>
<br>
It would be better if I had separate header files for the Dot and Timer classes. The general rule is you should
have a header file associated with each source file, but for the sake of not having to fumble with more files than
we need to, I lumped them together here.
</div>

<div class="tutCode">#ifndef FUNCTIONS_H
#define FUNCTIONS_H

//The headers
#include "SDL/SDL.h"
#include "SDL/SDL_image.h"
#include &#060string&#062

//File Loader
SDL_Surface *load_image( std::string filename );

//Surface blitter
void apply_surface( int x, int y, SDL_Surface* source, SDL_Surface* destination, SDL_Rect* clip = NULL );

//Initialization
bool init();

//File loading
bool load_files();

//Clean up
void clean_up();

#endif
</div>

<div class="tutText">
Here you see functions.h which has the declarations for the various utility functions. At the top we include the
SDL and string headers because the functions need to know what a string and SDL_Surface are.
</div>

<div class="tutCode">#ifndef GLOBALS_H
#define GLOBALS_H

//The header
#include "SDL/SDL.h"

//The surfaces
extern SDL_Surface *dot;
extern SDL_Surface *screen;

//The event structure
extern SDL_Event event;

#endif
</div>

<div class="tutText">
Here's the globals.h which contains the declarations for the global variables in the program. At the top you see
we included SDL.h because the header needs to know what an SDL_Surface is.<br>
<br>
Now the extern keyword you see infront of the global variables might be new to you. Well remember that header
files are just supposed to inform the compiler that something exists. If we didn't have extern infront of the
globals, when the header is included in a source file the compiler will create a copy of the variable for that
source file. Then when the linker tries to link everything together, it will find multiple copies of the same
variable and it will complain and abort.<br>
<br>
The extern keyword just tells the compiler the variable exists somewhere. Now you won't have multiple definitions
of the same variable, but where are the actual globals located? 
</div>

<div class="tutCode">//The headers
#include "SDL/SDL.h"
#include "globals.h"

//The surfaces
SDL_Surface *dot = NULL;
SDL_Surface *screen = NULL;

//The event structure
SDL_Event event;
</div>

<div class="tutText">
When the linker looks for the definitions for the of the globals, it'll find them in the global.cpp source file.
Also notice this is where we initialize the globals which makes sense since these are the actual variables and not
just a declaration.<br>
<br>
Just a tip: in case you mess up with the globals and get a multiple definiton error and then you fix the source
code but the linker still complains, try rebuilding the whole project. To save time, the compiler will only
recompile the source codes that have been changed, and since the source files haven't been changed, the linker
stll has them compiled with multiple definitons. Rebuilding them will get rid of the old compiled code.
</div>

<div class="tutCode">//The headers
#include "SDL/SDL.h"
#include "SDL/SDL_image.h"
#include &#060string&#062
#include "constants.h"
#include "classes.h"
#include "functions.h"
#include "globals.h"

Dot::Dot()
{
    //Initialize the offsets
    x = 0;
    y = 0;
    
    //Initialize the velocity
    xVel = 0;
    yVel = 0;
}
</div>

<div class="tutText">
Here's the top of the dot.cpp file which defines the Dot class.<br>
<br>
We include the SDL headers because we use SDL_Event and SDL_Surface types. We use the constants header for the dot
dimensions. The classes header has the dot declaration so that's a given. We need the functions header for
applying surfaces. Lastly we need the globals header to apply stuff to the screen.
</div>

<div class="tutCode">#include "SDL/SDL.h"
#include "classes.h"

Timer::Timer()
{
    //Initialize the variables

    paused = false;
    started = false;
