<div class="tutPreface"><h1 class="tutHead">Starting out on Game Programming</h1>
<h6>Last Updated 7/24/17</h6>
The path to game development is a long one.
This article is here to give you an idea where to go to help you out on your journey.
</div>

<div class="tutText">
So you've just finished your first semester of C++ and you want to start making games.
Somebody pointed you to this site and you've been playing around with the tutorials.
You learned some neat stuff but there's no tutorials to make a full game.
There's a reason for that.<br>
<br>
Tutorials are great for teaching you how to do something
step by step like how to move a dot around on the screen. To put a game together
you need problem solving skills and that's something you learn through experience.
It's not something that can be given through a tutorial. The best way to learn to make games is
to start making them.<br>
<br>
<h3>Picking a Project</h3>
So where do you start? An easier question to ask is where not to start and that's with something
huge like an full 3D FPS, MMO, or even a full length 16bit era platformer. The most common mistake
beginning game programmers make is coming up with a Cool Idea and taking on huge project or taking on
a project they think is simple and end up with a half finished pile of spaghetti code. When starting
out, you should aim to keep your projects small.<br>
<br>
In your early projects especially your number one goal is to learn, not Cool Ideas. By keeping your project
small, you can focus on learning new techniques instead of spending hours managing source code and refactoring.
While your Cool Idea may be awesomely awesome, the reality of software development is that the bigger the project
the more likely you are to make a mistake in the design. And a mistake in the design is much more costly the larger
the project is.<br>
<br>
Remember the story of Daedalus and his son Icarus. Daedalus made wings out of wax and feathers for him and his son.
Daedalus warned his son not to fly too close to the sun with his new wings. Icarus ignored this and his wings melted
and that's when gravity had its way with him.<br>
<div class="tutImg"><img src="icarus.jpg"><br>
So remember not to fly too close to the sun with your new coding wings.
</div>
<br>
With all that in mind here's some tips on where to go.<br>
<br>
<h3>Graphics, Event Handling</h3>
If you've never done any programming involving graphics or GUIs before you should
do something small to get your feet wet. My first project was Tic Tac Toe so even
I had my humble beginnings. Here's some ideas for a first project:
<ul>
<li>Slot Machine Simulation<br><img src="slot.png"></li>
<li>Black Jack<br><img src="jack.png"></li>
<li>Tic Tac Toe<br><img src="ttt.png"></li>
<li>Connect Four<br><img src="c4.png"></li>
</ul>
The goal of your first project is to transition you from text driven console
programs to event driven graphical programs. It will also teach you the fundamentals
of game logic and design. I recommend something turn based because games with
motion are a whole 'nother animal.<br>
<br>
Make sure to keep it simple so you finish it and don't lose interest
halfway through and never finish your game. It's important to get your games done because
you're not learning the game development process if you have a bunch of half finished games
on your computer.<br>
<br>
There's one thing I want to point out for those doing Tic Tac Toe or Connect Four.
AI is something you don't want to worry about too much for now. Making your game two player only
or with a computer opponent that does moves at random is good enough when you're starting
out.<br>
<br>
If you've done graphics and event handling before and you're comfortable with it, you can
try and go directly to the next step. 
<br>
<h3>Timing, Motion, Collision, Animation</h3>
Now that you played with graphics it's time to move onto something that's real time.
Here's some suggestions:<br>
<ul>
<li>Duck Hunt<br><img src="dh.png"></li>
<li>Pong<br><img src="pong.png"></li>
<li>Space Invaders<br><img src="invaders.png"></li>
<li>Galaga<br><img src="galaga.png"></li>
<li>Tetris<br><img src="lb.png"></li>
</ul>
Here you get acquainted with motion, time, animation, collision detection, game loops,
score/win/loss calculations and many important basic concepts used in every game.<br>
<br>
Duck Hunt and Pong are good first projects for those who have done graphics and events before.
They have simple collision detection and all the important basics of real time games.<br>
<br>
Space Invaders and Galaga make good second/third projects. They have levels so you'll have to
know how to move from level to level using a state machine. You can read more about state
machines <a class="tutLink" href="../article06/index.php.html">here</a>.
Shoot 'em ups also require you make
some sort of simple enemy patterns which serves as a stepping stone to Artificial Intelligence.<br>
<br>
Tetris makes a good second/third project. There's quite a bit of logic that goes into
make a puzzle game. It's a decent size game so you'll have to learn you to split your program
into multiple source files, which you can read more about <a class="tutLink" href="../article07/index.php.html">here</a>.
Don't underestimate Tetris. I did and just look at the garbled mess that is the Lazy Blocks source code.<br>
<br>
<h3>Over Engineering</h3>
A common newbie mistake is to try to make The Greatest Game Ever and then end up
over engineering. Over engineering is when they try spend bunch of time coding the greatest game/engine ever
and only end up using a small part of what they code.<br>
<br>
I over engineered in my newbie days when I made made the AI for my Tic Tac Toe game. I wanted to make
a game with unbeatable AI. I managed to get it done by programming the computer to know
every possible trap. Sounds great doesn't it? This took over 40,000 lines of mostly copy/pasted code and a month of my free time.
Later on as I studied data structures, I found out about the Minimax Algorithm which
not only can do it with much less code, it can also do it better.<br>
<br>
So learn from my mistakes and don't get overly ambitious. You're focusing on learning <b>how</b> to make games,
not <b>just</b> making them.
<br>
<h3>Planning Ahead, Collision Resolution, Physics, Levels, AI</h3>
<div class="tutImg"><img src="break.png"> <img src="pb.png"></div>
<div class="tutImg"><img src="pool.png"><img src="pm.png"></div>
Now that you've got 2 or 3 small games under your belt it's time for your first big project.<br>
<br>
Up until now you've probably been coding as you go. That ends here. In the real world most
of the software development process is done before a single line of code is typed. Nothing sucks worse
than wanting to add something to your game and realizing you'll have to throw out all your code because you
didn't plan ahead. Now that you have experience making games, you know what the game development process consists
of. Now you can plan out your games before you make them.<br>
<br>
Now onto your next game.
Break Out and Puzzle Bobble are good 3rd projects because they involve some more advanced collision detection and
physics. Physics is important because it gives the game a realistic feel. Even Super Mario Brothers
had a sense of gravity and inertia. For those of you really looking to flex your physics muscle,
a pool game is an excellent project.<br>
<br>
With games like pool you not only have to detect collisions, you'll need to have to process them in a certain order.
Handling collisions is a whole different beast when comparing to collision detection. While make pool or a 2D platformer
may look simple, doing collision resolution operations in the right order is a tricky process not to be underestimated.<br>
<br>
Break out and Puzzle Bobble also involve level design and having to load and free level resources. It's good experience
to make a level design application for game. Level design programs allow you to easily make levels and not have to
hard code your levels into your application. I have an article on making a level editor, you can check it out
<a class="tutLink" href="../article09/index.php.html">here</a>.<br>
<br>
Another thing you want to practice is Artificial Intelligence (AI). One way to practice AI is
you could go back to your Tic Tac Toe or Connect Four game and add unbeatable AI. By now you should
know data structures and you can use your knowledge of trees to use the Minimax Algorithm.
With the Minimax Algorithm you can calculate every possible outcome of you Tic Tac Toe game
and have the AI be undefeatable. It's fun to frustrate your friends with.
You probably want to also learn to make varying levels of AI. A game isn't fun if you can never win.<br>
<br>
Pac Man is an excellent way to practice AI. For one thing you need to know tree/graph data structures, and path finding
algorithms like A* so the ghosts know how to move through the maze. You also have to make the ghosts work as a team. All
this will be useful when making AI heavy games like Real Time Strategies. You can read more about the basics of AI
<a class="tutLink" href="../article08/index.php.html">here</a>.<br>
<br>

<h3>Side Scrollers, Action/Adventure, RPGs, RTSs, Engines</h3>
<div class="tutImg"><img src="mario.png"> <img src="sonic.png"></div>
<div class="tutImg"><img src="ffvi.png"><img src="wc.png"></div>
Now that you have experienced making a well planned out game you're ready make a
Action/Adventure/Side Scroller. This will be the culmination of graphics, motion, animation,
collision detection/resolution, physics, AI, software design, and everything else you learned up until this point.
For the more ambitious among you, you can try to make Strategy or Role Playing Game. Be careful because
RPGs and RTSs games are huge projects.<br>
<br>
RPGs are highly architectural, and require a lot of planning. You need plan out every
weapon, armor, accessory, attack, item, spell, summon, enemy, map, boss, dungeon,
you-name-it down to the littlest detail. It all has to go together seamlessly and it's not an easy task
to say the least. So if your design document looks like a movie script or comic, your RPG needs <b>a lot</b>
more work.<br>
<br>
RTSs are just as architectural, but they also require a lot of AI. You have to do path finding, have them
accept commands, and give them different behaviors based on the commands. If you've never done anything
with AI before, it would best if you made a Pac Man clone first.<br>
<br>
This will probably be the first time have you'll make an engine for your game. One thing you want to avoid
is tying to make the "do anything" engine. When making an engine you don't make one that tries to do anything
any game will ever need. You have a game that needs x, y, and z so you make an engine that does x, y, and z.
Engines come from what a game needs, not what any game could potentially need.<br>
<br>
Another common newbie mistake is trying to make an engine as a first project. Also it's typically a
"do anything" engine. You don't need a fancy graphics engine to make pong or space invaders. With programming it's
easy to get bogged down in the details. Focus on the big picture and getting your games done.<br>
<br>
<h3>Networking</h3>
It seems everybody wants to make the next big MMO. Making online games is not something you just jump into.
I learned that the hard way when I tried to make an online poker game after just finishing Tic Tac Toe.<br>
<br>
Networking a game adds so much more complexity. When one player does something, you have to send that
information to all the other players. It's like your right hand doesn't know what your left hand is doing.
You also have to do a balancing act with server load vs server control. The more the server program does
the less the client can cheat but it also means more stress on the server. For action and other fast
paced games you have to worry about latency and missed packets.<br>
<br>
You should at least have one well planned out game finished before even attempting a networked game. As a
first networking project, so you should do something where speed is not a big concern. Making a simple
chat server/client is good practice. You could also go back to that Tic Tac Toe/Connect Four game you
made and add online play. You can also try making an online card game, or board game.<br>
<br>
After your first online project is done, you can shoot for something real time. In your first project
you probably used TCP which makes sure that the data you send makes it across in the order you sent
it. For anything with a lot of action going on, the latency TCP has is too much so you'll
have to use UDP. UDP has no guarantees whether the data will be received in order or even be received at all.
Since UDP doesn't have additional checks for data integrity it's faster. You'll have to deal with sacrificing
ease of use of TCP for the speed of UDP and having to make your own data integrity check when you make your
game.<br>
<br>
<h3>3D Games</h3>
Before attempting 3D games you should have at least one well planned out game and have an excellent
understanding of 3D vector math, linear and newtonian physics. There's much more you have to deal with here like
vertex data, texturing, lighting, shading, picking, model loading, and other complicated sounding things.<br>
<br>
The good thing is you have 4 or 5 games done already, so you know the fundamentals of what it takes to make a game.
You're already well acquainted with the development process and you know your abilities as a programmer.
Whether a game is a 2D shooter or 3D shooter, it's still a shooter. Whether a game is a 2D RPG or a 3D RPG, it's
still an RPG.<br>
<br>
Don't take this as an excuse to skip 2D and get into 3D too early. You need to walk before you can run.<br>
<br>
<h3>Jumping in</h3>
So you say you learn faster by jumping in and you'll learn by just making your dream 3D MMOFPSRTSRPG
and you'll just pick up what you need as you need it. Well here's a guide to help you along your way:
<ol>
<li>Go to your local market.</li>
<li>Buy a whole fish. Salmon or Cod is recommended but even a Catfish will do. Trout is also quite effective.</li>
<li>Go home and turn on your computer.</li>
<li>Start up your IDE of choice.</li>
<li>Now take that fish you bought and smack yourself in the head with it.</li>
<li>Repeat step 5 until the thought of "jumping in" leaves your mind.</li>
</ol>
You didn't learn algebra by doing calculus problems. You learned the fundamentals
and then built on them. The same goes with game programming. If you're looking for a shortcut I'm here to
tell you there aren't any. Don't rush yourself, learn the basics and build on them. Otherwise you're going to
crash and burn.<br>
<br>
<h3>The Journey Begins</h3>
Now that you have a general idea on what you should do, it's time to get started on your game dev'ing.
I don't expect anybody to follow this guide word for word. Everybody learns differently and at different speeds.
If there's anything you should take from this article, it's these 3 things:
<ol>
<li>Pace yourself.</li>
<li>Make sure to get your games done.</li>
<li>Focus on learning, not just making games.</li>
</ol>
<br>
Good luck to all of you on your game dev'ing.
